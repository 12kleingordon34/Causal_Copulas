```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contents
The current contents of this directory are as follows:
* [`numpyro_samplers`](./numpyro_samplers/)
	* [`exploratory_copula_demo.ipynb`](numpyro_samplers/exploratory_copula_demo.ipynb): Contains a record of preliminary attempts to sample from copula models considered by E&D.
* [`EDAs`](./EDAs/) contain exploratory analyses of simulation outputs.
